## Cryptocurrency Price Prediction App

### Overview
The Cryptocurrency Price Prediction App is a web-based application designed to forecast the future prices of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) using advanced machine learning techniques. The app integrates both backend and frontend technologies, leveraging Node.js for server-side operations and React for a dynamic, user-friendly interface.

### Features
- **Historical Data Fetching**: Retrieves historical price data for BTC and ETH from reliable cryptocurrency APIs such as CoinGecko.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and normalizes the data, handling missing values and integrating technical indicators like moving averages and RSI for better predictions.
- **Model Training**: Implements a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model to train on historical data. The model's hyperparameters are fine-tuned to optimize accuracy.
- **Prediction & Visualization**: Uses the trained model to predict future prices, which are then presented in an intuitive format on the React frontend. Interactive charts and graphs visualize price trends and predictions.
- **API Endpoints**: RESTful APIs facilitate data fetching, model training, and predictions, ensuring smooth communication between the frontend and backend.
- **Scalability & Security**: Designed to handle concurrent requests and large datasets securely, protecting data integrity and user information.

### Technical Stack
#### Backend (Node.js)
- **Framework**: Express.js
- **Libraries**: TensorFlow.js for machine learning, Axios for API requests
- **Data Storage**: MongoDB for storing model weights and historical data
- **API Endpoints**: RESTful APIs for seamless interaction between frontend and backend

#### Frontend (React)
- **Component Library**: Material-UI for a modern look and feel
- **Charting Library**: Recharts for visualizing price data and predictions
- **Data Fetching**: Axios for communicating with backend APIs

### Additional Features (Optional)
- **User Authentication**: Allow users to create accounts and save their preferences.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Users can adjust model parameters or choose between different algorithms.
- **News & Sentiment Analysis**: Incorporate real-time news sentiment to potentially improve prediction accuracy.
- **Portfolio Tracking**: Enable users to track their crypto holdings and see how predictions would impact their investments.

### Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository**: 
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/crypto-price-prediction-app.git
    ```
